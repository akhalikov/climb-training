# 🗺 Climb Training App — Roadmap

This roadmap describes the planned development of the Climb Training App.  
It is divided into four major milestones: MVP, Training Intelligence, AI/Wearables, and Cloud Platform.

## 🚀 Milestone 1 — Functional MVP

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Week → date mapping engine  
- [ ] Weekly template system  
- [ ] Session editor UI  
- [ ] Session persistence in SQLite  
- [ ] Macrocycle navigation (Base, Build, Deload, Taper)

### UI/UX
- [ ] Improved Week View layout  
- [ ] Session type icons  
- [ ] Better session cards

## 🧱 Milestone 2 — Training Intelligence

### Training Logic
- [ ] Warm-up templates  
- [ ] Mobility templates  
- [ ] Age-aware training considerations  
- [ ] Weekly load calculation (intensity, volume)  
- [ ] Overload detection  

### UI
- [ ] Load graph overlay  
- [ ] Warm-up recommendations

## 🤖 Milestone 3 — AI & Wearables

### AI Engine
- [ ] AI weekly review  
- [ ] Session adjustment suggestions  
- [ ] Early injury risk detection  

### Garmin Integration
- [ ] HRV sync  
- [ ] Sleep & stress sync  
- [ ] Readiness score  
- [ ] Auto-regulation based on physiology

## ☁️ Milestone 4 — Cloud Platform

### Backend
- [ ] Next.js API  
- [ ] Prisma + PostgreSQL  
- [ ] Authentication  
- [ ] Sync engine (local ↔ cloud)

### Frontend Enhancements
- [ ] Multi-device support  
- [ ] Progress dashboard

## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

The app will evolve into an intelligent climbing training platform combining:

- Structured periodization  
- Physiology-based auto-regulation  
- AI-driven insights  
- Powerful training history analytics  

A tool that adapts training to **life, age, fatigue, and goals** — not the other way around.
